# Cloth segmentation model

This is pretty much a fork from [wildoctopus' repo](https://github.com/wildoctopus/huggingface-cloth-segmentation).
We just added the functionalities that we wanted in our pipeline and modified some code accordingly.

The model is a pre-trained U2NET model for Cloths Parsing from human portrait. Clothes are parsed into 3 categories: upper body, lower body and full body.
